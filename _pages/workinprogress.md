**Acting early under uncertainty: Anticipatory cash transfers in the context of flood disasters**   
with Stefan Dercon, Rohini Kamal, Prabhmeet Kaur Matta, Ashley Pople, Munshi Sulaiman and Hannah Timmis   
Grants: [J-PAL King Climate Action Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/improved-early-action-through-precise-targeting-timely-cash-and-early-warning) & Weiss Asset Management Foundation

The project evaluates a targeted risk-informed early action pilot in response to floods in Bangladesh, testing efficacy of early warning messaging, timing of cash transfers, and data-driven innovations in targeting approaches. Through a randomized evaluation, we will target approximately 20,000 households, with some households receiving unconditional cash transfers ahead of or after a flood event. We will address two critical knowledge gaps that impede adopting early actions at scale. First, they will explore the optimal timing for delivering assistance: they will evaluate when best to act by examining how households use assistance before, during, or after a disaster. Second, we will evaluate the accuracy of data-driven approaches in targeting the most vulnerable households and the trade-offs thus incurred vis-a-vis timing.

**Ignorance is bliss? Rejection and discouragement in on-the-job search**

I investigate the effect that experiencing repeated rejection has on on-the-job search. Using a lab-in-the-field experiment implemented with young workers in South Africa, I repeatedly ask subjects to choose between a high-return activity with frequent exposure to rejection signals and a lower-return activity with less frequent exposure to rejection signals. I ask whether subjects take costly action to avoid exposure to information on rejection by choosing the lower-return, lower-rejection activity. To do so, I experimentally vary both the rewards and the amount of rejection that subjects experience when choosing between the two tasks, holding other salient drivers of search behaviour constant, including eliminating the ability of players to learn about returns to search through experiencing rejection. I find that when exposed to (more frequent) rejection, subjects choose to trade-off expected earnings in order to avoid receiving rejection signals. I interpret these results as an example of active information avoidance.

Multifaceted social protection programs in low-income countries often include both capital grants and informational and behavioral support on the premise that households face simultaneous and multiple frictions. To tackle informational and behavioral constraints, programs typically deploy either individual or group coaching visits from f ield agents. The relative efficacy of individual versus group coaching could provide insights into the underlying mechanism through which information and behavioral support change household decisions. However, in three similar randomized evaluations in Uganda, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, we find no differences in efficacy. Given its 15â€“20% lower costs, group coaching is more cost-effective.

**Ultra-poor graduation programmes and resilience to climate shocks: A mixed-methods investigation in flood-prone Pakistan** \
with Nasir Iqbal and Saima Nawaz  
[Working Paper](www.theigc.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Nawaz-et-al-working-paper-march-2025.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
We assess the National Poverty Graduation Programme (NPGP) in Pakistan, focusing on its effectiveness in enhancing resilience against climate-induced shocks, particularly flooding. Using a mixed-method approach that combines regression discontinuity design (RDD) with qualitative in-depth interviews, we examine the short- and medium-term impacts of asset transfers on household well-being. We find that while asset transfers significantly improve food security, consumption, and savings among non-flooded households, these gains are not sustained during flood events. For flood-affected households, livestock becomes a liability, leading to increased borrowing and diminished resilience. These findings underscore a critical trade-off between asset accumulation and climate vulnerability, highlighting the need for more climate-resilient asset strategies in social protection programmes. The paper provides actionable policy insights for integrating adaptive social protection frameworks to enhance resilience in climate-vulnerable contexts.

**Welfare-Risk Trade-offs in Anticipatory Aid: A Portfolio Theory Approach**   
with Prabhmeet Kaur Matta   
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  This paper develops a portfolio optimization framework to analyze the allocation decisions of a social planner disbursing humanitarian aid in response to shocks that are amenable to forecasting. We model the social planner's three-pronged choice between investing in forecasting technology, deploying anticipatory aid based on existing forecasts, and providing post-shock assistance. Our approach treats the social planner as a portfolio manager evaluating risk-return trade-offs, where optimal allocations depend on the excess welfare gains above a baseline level of welfare and the volatility of these gains. Through simulation analysis, we demonstrate how forecasting accuracy fundamentally alters the effectiveness of anticipatory aid, with improvements in accuracy generating substantial initial welfare gains. Although advances in forecasting technologies and mobile money systems have enabled the growth of anticiptory aid, our model provides a structured approach to evaluating the conditions under which investments in forecast-based action generate the greatest welfare improvements, contributing to the emerging literature on cost-accuracy tradeoffs of anticipatory action frameworks in humanitarian contexts.
