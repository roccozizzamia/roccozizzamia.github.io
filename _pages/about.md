I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Center for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} and at the [Oxford Martin School](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, at the University of Oxford. I am affiliated to [Somerville College](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/our-people/rocco-zizzamia/){:target="_blank"} as a Fulford  Junior Research Fellow (2023-2025).

My research focuses on social protection and labour markets. In my current work, I am using experimental methods to study the potential to leverage innovations in the design and delivery of social protection systems to increase household resilience to poverty and to extreme climate events such as floods. In the past, I have researched labour markets, inequality, poverty alleviation, poverty dynamics, and social stratification, using a variety of methods, including longitudinal surveys, field experiments, qualitative studies, and behavioural lab experiments. 

I am an [African Centre of Excellence for Inequality Research](African Centre of Excellence for Inequality Research){:target="_blank"} and [SALDRU](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/){:target="_blank"} research affiliate.
