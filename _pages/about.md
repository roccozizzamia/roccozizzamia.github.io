I am a Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at the [Oxford Department of International Development](https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} and Research Fellow at the [Center for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, at the University of Oxford.  

My research focuses on social protection and labour markets. In my current work, I use experimental methods to study the potential to leverage innovations in the design and delivery of social protection systems to increase household resilience to poverty and to extreme climate events such as floods. In the past, I have researched labour markets, inequality, poverty alleviation, poverty dynamics, and social stratification, using a variety of methods, including longitudinal surveys, field experiments, qualitative studies, and behavioural lab experiments. 

I am an [African Centre of Excellence for Inequality Research](https://aceir.uct.ac.za/){:target="_blank"} affiliate, a [SALDRU](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/){:target="_blank"} research affiliate, and a [Berlin University Alliance](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/international/bua-fellows-club/bua-featured-fellows/inhaltselemente/profile-rocco-zizzamia.html){:target="_blank"} fellow. From 2023 to 2025 I was affiliated to [Somerville College](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/our-people/rocco-zizzamia/){:target="_blank"} as a Fulford Junior Research Fellow (2023-2025). I am currently the editor of the [CSAE Working Paper Series](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/working-papers){:target="_blank"}.

I feel most myself when I am doing difficult things in wild places. In my free time I run, climb and ride my bike.
